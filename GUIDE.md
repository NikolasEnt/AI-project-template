# Development Style Guide

The document describes basic principles and style guides to follow during the development of ML-related projects. This style guide should be applied to all code, which may eventually become part of a production system or potentially developed in collaboration.

## General development

* The choice of development tools is largely a matter of personal preference. Recommended IDEs are: VS Code, PyCharm and Vim.

* As many things as possible should be automated, including code and comments formatting. The template provides [pre-commit hooks](README.md#pre-commit-hooks) to automate some tasks on the developer side. In addition, it is good to have CI automation in place to run linters and tests.

* A new feature is considered implemented if it is documented and tested (it is good to cover the feature with autotests).

* Passwords, private access tokens, and similar secrets should never appear in the code directly. It is a common practice to define required parameters via environment variables (via `.env` [files](README.md#environment-variables)).


## Python

Most ML projects use Python as the main programming language; adhere to similar practices for other language of choice if it is not Python.

Good quality and uniform code style enhances code readability and maintainability, making it easier for new developers to quickly get up to speed.

* Follow [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) with a line length limit of 79. How to set: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/linting); [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/tutorial-code-quality-assistance-tips-and-tricks.html).

* Linters like  [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) and [mypy](https://pypi.org/project/mypy/) are helpful tools to improve code quality â€“ use them if possible. The template is [configured](README.md#pre-commit-hooks) to use ruff.

* It is a standard practice to use Python [type hints](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html). It makes debugging easier and helps to spot some potential problems automatically.

* Avoid using 'magic' numbers or strings; instead, define named constants, use configuration files and environment variables.

* Follow Google Style [Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) styleguide. How to set: [VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=njpwerner.autodocstring); [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/settings-tools-python-integrated-tools.html).

* It is a good practice to cover the production code by autotests, e.g., using [pytest](https://pypi.org/project/pytest/).

* Imports sorting could be done automatically with [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) using the following parameters: `--atomic -l=79 -m=HANGING_INDENT --ls`. The template is [configured](README.md#pre-commit-hooks) to use isort as a pre-commit hook.

* Use four whitespace characters for indentation in Python code. Two whitespace characters can be used for indentation in YAML and JSON files.

## Git

* Use a simplified [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow): the `develop` branch can be named `dev`. When working collaboratively, implement individual features or experiment series in separate feature branches. If these feature branches prove successful the feature developer merges them into `dev`. Update the `master` branch wisely to provide tested and reliable production-ready code. In many cases, a merge or commit to master effectively marks a new version release.

* Each commit must be accompanied by a meaningful commit message following the Udacity commit message [styleguide](http://udacity.github.io/git-styleguide/).

* Pull requests (PRs) and code reviews are strongly encouraged as a collaborative practice, but they are not mandatory. The primary objective of PRs is to leverage the collective expertise of the team by providing a second set of eyes on the code, which can proactively identify potential issues. Furthermore, PRs serve as a mechanism for sharing updates, particularly when multiple developers are expected to use or collaborate on it.

* Each logically complete code update should represent a separate commit, even if the change is a fix for a bug that required editing of one character.

* Data and artefacts (model's weights, datasets, etc.) should be stored separately (for example, in an object storage). Committed Jupyter notebooks should not contain cell outputs, especially images.

## ML Experiments and data management

* All data, used for ML training, as well as the code, should be backed up. A good approach is to use [DVC](https://dvc.org/doc) for data version control and management of the data in a Git repository.

* Significant ML/DL experiments should be logged in a "Lab journal" or an experiment logging system, such as [MLflow](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/index.html) or [ClearML](https://clear.ml/docs/latest/docs/). A description of an experiment should include all information required to reproduce the experiment, including: the relevant Git commit reference, data used, parameters of the training process and data transforms, evaluation metrics results. It is also crucial to include research goals and hypotheses for an experiment (e.g., "Try colour augmentation to deal with overfitting"), as well as results/conclusions (e.g., "It does not work!") and ideas on future work. This helps to reflect on the experiment and decide on the next steps more thoughtfully.

* The experiment logging system can also be used to store models and artifacts, as well as to automate experiments.

* It is a good practice to have a git commit for each experiment with corresponding experiment name tag. This approach, together with logging of the configuration files, used for experiments, helps with reproducibility and transparency of experimentation, which, in result, allows achieving better models faster.

* It is a good practice to use [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/docs/intro/) to configure experiments. This allows easy integration with [Optuna](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) for hyperparameter optimization.
